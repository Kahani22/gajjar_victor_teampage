			<h2>MEET<br>THE<br>TEAM</h2>
			<p><span>Kahani Gajjar</span> and <span>Sonali Victor</span> met as classmates and went on to form a strong collab team to fight every design challenge thrown at them. They have gathered the reputation to exchange the work that they're good at, push eachother to the limits but keep each other sane after a 12 hour sit-downs, endless coffees and darkening skies.</p>

				<h2>SONALI VICTOR</h2>
				<p>"I got into digital arts because of one person - the mentor of one of my school teachers.</p>
				<p>He is a 40-year-old man who loved creativity and imagination and is the CEO of a small graphic design school in India. He told me he was fascinated by my persepective to see art anywhere and everywhere and introduced me to the Adobe software.</p>
				<p>After that, I took great interest in digital painting, photography and video/audio editing and developing the skills to make my art into something that's not only good to look at but also useful. I left home and came to pursue the Interactive Media Design course here, this being the first step I take to become a digital artist."</p>
