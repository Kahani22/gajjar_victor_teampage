			<h2>MEET<br>THE<br>TEAM</h2>
			<p><span>Kahani Gajjar</span> and <span>Sonali Victor</span> met as classmates and went on to form a strong collab team to fight every design challenge thrown at them. They have gathered the reputation to exchange the work that they're good at, push eachother to the limits but keep each other sane after 12 hour sit-downs, endless coffees and darkening skies.</p>

				<h2>KAHANI GAJJAR</h2>
				<p> A design enthusiast with a strong observation skill; I enjoy being a part of Interior and Media design Industry along with food, fashion and lifestyle. Through the years, I have gone through a design process by experiencing different cultures and architecture which now has become a part of my thought process. Designing for people by keeping the user experience in mind is my passion.</p>
				<p> Having researched in Urban Interiors, I believe in creating spaces which are not bound to any restrictions and flow freely from Interior to urban to virtual nature. With the unique skill sets from Interior and Media Design, I thrive to create unique, spatial and virtual design experiences.</p>

				<h2>SONALI VICTOR</h2>
				<p>"I got into digital arts because of one person - the mentor of one of my school teachers.</p>
				<p>He is a 40-year-old man who loved creativity and imagination and is the CEO of a small graphic design school in India. He told me he was fascinated by my persepective to see art anywhere and everywhere and introduced me to the Adobe software.</p>
				<p>After that, I took great interest in digital painting, photography and video/audio editing and developing the skills to make my art into something that's not only good to look at but also useful. I left home and came to pursue the Interactive Media Design course here, this being the first step I take to become a digital artist."</p>
